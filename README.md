## How to install

> Github can be a pain in the ass if you don't understand how to use it. First download the Github dekstop app. This will save you a lot of time and trouble. When you're on my github page you will see a green button with "code". Click on this button and click on "open with github desktop". Now you can use my code on your on computer and make it your own.
