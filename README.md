## Features

### Loadingstate
> When your internet is slow the page will load slowly. To make sure that the user knows that the quotes are on the way, I created a loading state where there will be explained that the user needs to be patience and that the quotes are comming.

## How to install

> Github can be a pain in the ass if you don't understand how to use it. First download the Github dekstop app. This will save you a lot of time and trouble. When you're on my github page you will see a green button with "code". Click on this button and click on "open with github desktop". Now you can use my code on your on computer and make it your own.

## The API
This is the API I used:

In this API there are inspirational quotes about webdesign. When there are new quotes added they will appear in the single page webapp.
